Third Eye:A comprehensive Assistive System for the Visually Impaired

Visual impairment is a severe handicap to people for doing routine activities like picking out clothes to wear, purchasing groceries, shopping for clothes, choosing dishes from a menu at restaurants and other seemingly normal chores.
Here, we aim to develop a system that aids the visually impaired in identifying the color and patterns of clothes thereby giving them a descriptive visual of the same. Also, we attempt to perform text recognition on everyday objects like business and menu cards.
Our goal is to come up with an interactive, user-friendly system which takes in commands as voice input from the user, performs the desired action and reports the pertinent information back to the user as voice output. By adding an intelligent assistant, the system would also be able to respond to generic requests.
